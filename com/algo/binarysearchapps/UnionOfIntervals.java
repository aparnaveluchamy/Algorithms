/*
 * Given a list of integers, find the n-th smallest number, i.e., 
 * the number that appears at index n (0-based) when they are sorted in non-descending order. 
 * The numbers will be given in intervals. For example, the intervals (1, 3) and (5, 7) represent the list of numbers { 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7 }. 
 * A number may be present in more than one interval, and it appears in the list once for each interval it is in. 
 * For example, the intervals (1, 4) and (3, 5) represent the list of numbers { 1, 2, 3, 3, 4, 4, 5 }. 
 * The intervals will be given as two int[]s, lowerBound and upperBound. 
 * The i-th elements of these int[]s represent the smallest and largest numbers in the i-th interval, inclusive.
