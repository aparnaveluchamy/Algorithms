/*
 * 	Our barbershop opens at 9:00 am and closes at 5:00 pm, but (of course) the barber keeps working until all the
 *  customers who entered the shop before 5:00 have been served. Each customer enters the shop and if the barber is 
 *  free, immediately starts getting his hair cut. Otherwise, the customer waits until everyone who entered 
 *  before him has finished getting their hair cut. We have the sequence of times when customers entered
 *   the shop and we know when the last customer left the shop. We also know that each haircut took at least 5 minutes. 
 *   We want to get a bound on how long the longest haircut took. 
 *  
 *   Create a class HairCuts that contains a method maxCut that is given String[] enter and String lastExit and 
 *   that returns the smallest possible time (in minutes) that the longest haircut took. If the inputs 
 *   are inconsistent with the rule that each haircut takes at least 5 minutes, return -1. 
 *   
 *   The enter times and the lastExit are 5 character Strings in the format hh:mm with hh being a 12 hour time.
